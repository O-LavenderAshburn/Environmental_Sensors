## Projects

### [Enviromental Sensors Project](https://github.com/O-LavenderAshburn/CreativeWork/tree/main/EnviroSensors)  
This reop presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a BLE-
based IoT system for environmental monitoring, comprising of an always-on
gateway and sensor nodes. The gateway continuously scans for sensor nodes
within range, establishes BLE connections, and queries them for environmental
data, specifically temperature and humidity.

#### Scope

The goal of this project was to develop a BLE-enabled gateway capable of discovering and
reading environmental sensor data. The sensor nodes need to provide temperature (Â°C) and
humidity (%) readings from a Hts221 sensor.The key challenge is to get the sensor discovery
below 100ms
